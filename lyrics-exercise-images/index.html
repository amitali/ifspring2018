			Now that you're out of my life I'm so much better<br>
			You thought that I'd be weak without you, but I'm stronger<br>
			You thought that I'd be broke without you, but I'm richer<br>
			You thought that I'd be sad without you, I laugh harder<br>
			You thought I wouldn't grow without you Now I'm wiser<br>
			Thought that I'd be helpless without you, but I'm smarter<br>
			You thought that I'd be stressed without you but I'm chillin'<br>
			You thought I wouldn't sell without you Sold 9 million

			I'm a survivor (What?)<br>
			I'm not gon' give up (What?)<br>
			I'm not gon' stop (What?)<br>
	        I'm gon' work harder (What?)<br>
	        I'm a survivor (What?)<br>
