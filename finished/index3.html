It was designed to conduct closeup scientific observations of Mars and to transmit these observations to Earth. Launched on November 28, 1964,[1] Mariner 4 performed the first successful flyby of the planet Mars, returning the first pictures of the Martian surface.</p>

The Mars 2 and Mars 3 missions consisted of identical spacecraft, each with an orbiter and an attached lander. The lander of Mars 2 became the first man-made object to reach the surface of Mars, although the landing system failed and the lander was lost.</p>

The Mars 2020 mission addresses high-priority science goals for Mars exploration, including key questions about the potential for life on Mars. The mission takes the next step by not only seeking signs of habitable conditions on Mars in the ancient past, but also searching for signs of past microbial life itself.</p>
