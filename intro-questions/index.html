		<p>Hi! My name is Mitali. I'm a senior, studying Electrical Engineering.</p>
		<p class = "ques">2. Tell me a bit about your background and what prompted you to take this class.</p>
		<p>	I have a background in coding, but I am mostly interested in learning about design. I want to learn more about UI and learning these skills would be relevant.</p>
		<p class = "ques">3. Do you have any experience with HTML/CSS/JS? If so, tell me a bit about it.</p>
		<p>I have some experience, but I haven't used it in a while.</p>
		<p class = "ques">4. Name one thing you hope to learn in this class.</p>
		<p>	I hope to learn more JS and how to design reactive websites.</p>
		<p class = "ques">5. Name one way you expect designing for screen to be different from designing for paper.</p>
		<p>I expect designing for a screen to be different because you have reactivity. Also, movement through a site isnt linear like how it is in a book,</p>
		<p class = "ques">6. Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective design. Explain your choice.</p>
		<p>blah</p>
		<p class = "ques">7. Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective communication. Explain your choice.</p>

		<p class = "ques">8. Provide a link to a website you think works well. Explain your choice.</p>
