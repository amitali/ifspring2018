			<p>[verse 1 - Justin Vernon]<br>
				I'm up in the woods. I'm down on my mind.<br> 
				I'm building a still To slow down time<br>
				I'm up in the woods I'm down on my mind<br> 
				I'm building a still To slow down the time<br>
				I'm up in the woods I'm down on my line<br>
				I'm building a still down the time ooh<br>
				I'm up in the woods I'm down on my line<br>
				I'm building a still down the time<br> 
				ooh I'm lost in the world I'm down on my line<br>
				I'm new in the city And I'm down for the night 
				Down for the night, said shes down for the night<br>
			</p>

			[verse 2 - Kanye West]<br>
			I'm lost in the world I'm down on my line I'm new in the city But I'm down for the night<br>
			Down for the night, down for the night<br>
			Your my devil, your my angel Your my heaven, your my hell<br>
			You're my now, you're my forever You're my freedom, your my jail<br>
			You're my lies, your my truth You're my war, you're my truce<br>
			Your my questions, your my proof Your my stress your masseuse<br>
			Mama say mama say mama gos-an<br>
			Lost in this plastic light Let's break out of this fake a** party<br>
			Turn this into a classic night
			</p>

			[verse 3 - Kanye West and Justin Vernon]<br>	
			I'm up in the woods, I'm down on my mind<br>
			(Run from the lights, run from the night)<br>
			I'm new in the city, but I'm down for the night<br>
			(Run for your life, down for the night)<br>
			I'm lost in the world, been down my whole life<br>
			I'm new in the city, and I'm down for the night<br>
			Down for the night<br>
			Down for the night<br>
